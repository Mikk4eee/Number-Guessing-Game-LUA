# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! Originally implemented in C++, this simple game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Below is the adapted version of the game for Lua, providing a similar experience in a different programming language.

## How to Play
1. The game starts by welcoming the player and displaying a character graphic.
2. The player inputs a minimum and maximum number for the guessing range.
3. The game generates a random number within the specified range.
4. The player inputs their guess.
5. If the guess matches the generated number, the player wins 2 points. If the guess is within 4 numbers higher or lower than the generated number, the player wins 1 point. Otherwise, the player loses the round.

## Fun Facts
- Did you know that the concept of guessing games dates back centuries? Games involving guessing elements have been part of human entertainment for a long time.
